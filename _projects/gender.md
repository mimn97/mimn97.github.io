title: Gender and Power Dynamics in Latin Narratives
subtitle: Final Project for the course 'Responsible AI'
---


Latin-specific language models are trained on Latin text, so they may learn the gender prejudice embedded in these ancient corpora. It is thus important to understand the extent to which the data is biased before using these models' outcomes for interpretation. In this project, we study gender discrimination in the Latin narrative poem *Metamorphoses* by Ovid. Specifically, we will use word embedding and topic models to study the differences in words and themes associated with each gender.
