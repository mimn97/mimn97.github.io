title: Can Pre-trained Models in the Clinical Domain Detect Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health from Tweets? 
subtitle: Submitted to AMIA 2022 Annual Symposium
---

**Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH)** are the conditions of the environments in which people are born, live, work, and age, as well as individual-level behavioral determinants of health (e.g., smoking, substance use and alcohol consumption) and mental health status (e.g., depression and loneliness). Also, community-level factors of SBDH such as neighborhood environment have been shown to play an important role in individuals’ health outcomes such as diabetes. 

In this work, we investigated whether NLP models trained on clinical corpora can generalize well on tweets for reliable SBDH prediction. Then, we examined whether there is association between the models’ zero-shot performance and the two following features: (1) the number of grammatical errors on tweets and (2) the neighborhood environment that the tweets are created within.

<!-- ## Conclusion

Our work called attention to developing pre-trained clinical-domain models that can also perform well on social media texts for SBDH detection. As a future work, we intend to improve these two models for social media text. We believe that in-depth analyses of tweets will be needed to develop the model that precisely understands the characteristics of users, such as the timeline and history of the tweets, temporal and spatial distribution of the tweets, and the community-level health outcome analysis. The continuing work will provide a robust pipeline for improving the current system of public health surveillance through social media texts.  -->
