(*This work is the final project for the course 'Advanced NLP' at UMass Amherst during Fall 2021.*)


We aim to build a prototype of a medical question-answering chatbot. Open-domain question-answering on real-world conversational data is a difficult problem, especially for specialized domains, like medicine. Because of the scope of this project, we implemented only a few key pieces of the chatbot. Namely, we fine-tuned a large Transformer-based model (e.g., BioBERT and DialoGPT) on a real-world medical dialogue dataset and attempted to optimize the model. Specifically, we investigated several different architectures, and we added a simple information retrieval component. The information retrieval component finds the most similar conversation in the training set to the question asked of the model and prepends the conversation to the question. We also applied various preprocessing techniques to improve the modelâ€™s performance. In the end, we compared our models to a baseline and evaluated all models using manual human evaluation and automatic measures.
