title: Sequential Sentence Classification for Longer Documents
subtitle: Research work with Bloomberg LP
---


The task of sequential sentence classification (SSC) has been shown to perform well on short-length documents. However, SSC is less successful on long-form documents such as full papers and clinical notes. Our work made four contributions to the SSC task. First, we quantify the factors that explain the performance gap between short and long-form documents. Second, we study the effect of longer context in [one (Cohan et al., 2019)](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1383.pdf) of the baselines's approach to SSC task. Third, we pose the problem of SSC as an intent of discrete classification. Lastly, we show a transfer learning setup with the five datasets of interest, which raises questions of the performance of SSC in such a setup.
