Most of my recent work focuses on examining **social (and behavioral) determinants of health (SBDH)**, the environmental and behavioral conditions that impact health outcomes of individuals. Examples of SBDH are as follows: 

- socio-economic status
- demographics (e.g., race, gender, age)
- neighborhood environment
- acccess to healthcare 
- substance use, alcohol, physical activity, etc. 

SBDH are one of very important topics in public health research, as it is crucial to identify health disparities across the nation, inform clinical decision making, and eventually impact health equity. However, these attributes are multifaceted and not easily measured. 

To address this problem, I have conducted initial work using NLP approaches at UMass Amherst, supervised by Prof. Hong Yu. Particularly, I have worked on extracting **SBDH evidence from Twitter**. 

Here are main projects related to the topic: 

(1) ["Can Pre-trained Models in the Clinical Domain Detect Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health from Tweets?"](/projects/nlp_for_social_good_clinical.html) (Preprint, 2022)

(2) "Local Tweets to Local Health: A Mental Health Surveillance Framework Based on Twitter Data" (Working Paper, 2023)
