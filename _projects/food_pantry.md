**Abstract**

**Food insecurity (FI)** is an important social determinant of health, impacting more than 10% of the US population. Food pantries (FPs) directly address FI and often work with state, tribal, and local health and safety regulations with which organizations must comply to provide food to families. In this study, we identified current distributions of FPs in the continental US and their geographic accessibility. We then examined associations between FPs and neighborhood characteristics, including rurality, socio-demographics, and neighborhood disadvantage in Census block groups. Results suggest that neighborhoods with higher area deprivation did not have greater accessibility to FPs than neighborhoods with comparatively lower deprivation. FPs in rural areas were located farther away from residents than in urban areas, after controlling for socioeconomic conditions. It is important that policymakers and government agencies work to locate FPs in neighborhoods with more social deprivation and rurality.
